A few months ago, I didn't see the appeal in content management systems --- in this blog post I'm going to explain why I've changed my mind and how to choose the right CMS for you.\n\n## Why Use a Content Management System?\n\nIn my opinion, a content management system is used to abstract the content of a website away from the code. Before I started using a CMS, everything was all squished together in a Git repository; when I wanted to make a new blog post, I would open up Visual Studio Code and create a new Markdown file for the blog post.

If you used WordPress as your CMS of choice, you typically had to use WordPress to create your website as well as the content, this is known as a monolithic or traditional CMS.

Essentially, all of your content is stored in your Git repository.\n\n**Pros:**\n\n- Version control straight out-of-the-box\n- Easily revert changes (using your version control system)\n- You can easily switch between Git-based CMSs\n- No change to the workflow for developers\n- It's really simple!\n\n**Cons:**\n\n- Flat-file storage like Markdown isn't suited to lots of content\n- New content will trigger a build every time\n\n### API-Based CMSs\n\nAn API-based CMS stores all your content in their database. When you edit content, nothing implicitly changes, although you may want to send a webhook to your build process. When you build your website, you will make a request to the API (usually REST or GraphQL) to retrieve the content.\n\n**Pros:**\n\n- You can use the content for multiple websites and/or applications\n- It can easily handle large amounts of data\n- Add new content as often as you want, without necessarily triggering a build\n\n**Cons:**\n\n- Version control of your content is now down to the CMS\n- API-based CMSs usually have storage and usage limits, which can cost\n- Changing your API-based CMS will require changes to how you retrieve your content\n\n## Why I Chose Forestry.io\n\nAs all of the content on my website was already stored in the `contents` directory of my Git repository, it seemed obvious to use a Git-based CMS. I found a number of options, including [Forestry.io](https://forestry.io/), [Publii](https://getpublii.com/) and [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/). Each of these uses a different way of accessing the CMS:\n\n- Forestry.io provides a hosted dashboard\n- Publii needs to be downloaded as a local application\n- Netlify CMS is hosted by you, on your website\n\nI wanted to be able to edit my content online but I didn't want the hassle (although it's probably very straightforward) of setting up Netlify CMS.
