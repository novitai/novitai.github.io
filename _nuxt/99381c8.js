The website was designed with four pages in mind:\n\n- The home page aims to provide an overview of the band, with some photos of the band in action, a news section and finally a short description of the band and its function.\n- A concerts page should promote the band's upcoming concerts, providing ticketing information and possibly a banner or graphic designed for the concert.\n- Members of the band should be able to upload images to the gallery page with little configuration.\n- Finally, the contact page allows potential customers to enquire about the band.\n\n## Technology\n\nJekyll seemed a perfect static site generator for the job as future members of the band would be able to edit the website simply by editing or adding markdown files. News posts and concerts would be easily handled by Jekyll's built in blog functionality.\n\nI designed the website using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) and some custom styles, nothing too fancy!
