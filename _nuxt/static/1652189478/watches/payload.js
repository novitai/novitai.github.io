It has achieved worldwide fame and is loved by everyone, including Bill Gates. According to Casio, they’ve sold 600,000 of them worldwide. When I was looking for my first affordable diver’s watch, the Casio Duro immediately stood out to me: with a uni-directional rotating bezel, a screw-down crown and 200 m water resistance, you get a lot of watch for your money. Let’s take a look at the case of the Casio Duro first and how it fits on my small 6-inch wrist. The diameter of the case is 44 mm and it does wear like a 44 mm, with a lug-to-lug of 48 mm. This is really pushing the limits of my wrist, which only measures 52 mm across, however, the curved lugs do help the watch to sit flush on my wrist. The height of the case is 12 mm, which felt very bulky coming from a Casio"}]}],fetch:{"0":{_error:{name:a,message:"unauthorized.
